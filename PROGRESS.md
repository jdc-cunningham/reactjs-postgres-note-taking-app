I have two whole days... of course I don't want to spend that much time on this particular project.
I gotta get something that works... I bought more ram now will have 32GB yeah boiii
Also still need a chrome extension to group tabs per window/allow you to store by group for later inspection with a note
These extensions exist but I want my own/disclose the code that runs it fully so nothing sketch
Pointless paranoia I get it

One ugly but functional/simple state UI is a dropdown to change between view/new/delete.
The issue is the state management. In particular I'm aiming for a "onKeyUp" sort of deal for saving.
But the title itself... when is that editable? Should the title be in an input so it's editable all the time. That seems like it would look bad.

For the sake of getting it done, I could make a really dumb interface. Eg. two of them. One for viewing, one to create a new one.

I'm currently dealing with this issue of ref is undefined... I don't know why I've used it so many times but maybe it's how I'm using it.

The other issue is not having a save button. It would be more obvious in function how to use it. I've built this same thing already like 2-3 years ago called ProjectLayout and it works... the interface is different/built for mobile but still... going in circles. That one required auth though.

Yeah I'm just going to build this in a really dumb way for the sake of getting it done. I can combine the interface/clean it up later.

I am pretty bad at React currently, I mean like state management alone "right ways to do it" where lifecycles get triggered.
I'm bad because I don't get to use it in a day job at this time.

Damn it cors issue...

So it did completely slip my mind to make a way on the front end to insert notes.
Also other features like loading last opened.
Yeah this UI is kind of trash.

Making a dynamic render is kind of hard in terms of organization, the different states the UI can be in.
That feeling of pointlessness/running out of time creeps in the back of my mind.
